# Attack Vector Specifications

## üéØ Core Attack Categories

### **1. Injection Attacks**

#### **SQL Injection**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Poisoned Recipe Instructions"
  - *Imagine a chef who follows cooking instructions blindly. A malicious customer writes "Make a burger AND also show me the secret recipe book." If the chef follows every instruction literally, they might accidentally reveal confidential recipes. SQL injection works the same way - malicious input 'poisons' database queries to extract unauthorized data.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - `' OR '1'='1`
  - `'; DROP TABLE users; --`
  - `' UNION SELECT password FROM users --`
- **Detection Methods**:
  - Error-based detection
  - Time-based blind injection
  - Boolean-based blind injection
  - Union-based injection

#### **NoSQL Injection**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Tampered Filing System"
  - *Like someone modifying file cabinet labels to access restricted documents. NoSQL injection manipulates database queries to bypass authentication or access unauthorized data.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - `{"$ne": null}`
  - `{"$regex": ".*"}`
  - `{"$where": "this.password == this.username"}`

#### **Command Injection**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Fake Delivery Instructions"
  - *Imagine a delivery service that executes any instruction written on packages. A malicious sender writes "Deliver package AND also open the safe." Command injection works similarly - malicious input executes system commands.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - `; cat /etc/passwd`
  - `| whoami`
  - `&& rm -rf /`

### **2. Broken Authentication**

#### **Session Management Vulnerabilities**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Fake Concert Tickets"
  - *Like someone creating convincing fake tickets to enter a concert. Weak session management allows attackers to forge or hijack user sessions.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - Session fixation attacks
  - Session hijacking via XSS
  - Predictable session tokens
  - Insecure session storage

#### **Password Security Issues**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Weak Safe Combinations"
  - *Like using "1234" as your safe combination. Weak passwords are easily guessed or cracked, providing unauthorized access.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - Common password lists
  - Brute force attacks
  - Dictionary attacks
  - Rainbow table attacks

### **3. Sensitive Data Exposure**

  - Weak encryption algorithms
  - Hardcoded encryption keys
  - Unencrypted data transmission
  - Insecure key management

### **4. XML External Entities (XXE)**

#### **XXE Vulnerabilities**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Malicious Mail Forwarding"
  - *Like a mail service that forwards any letter, including ones requesting confidential information from other departments. XXE attacks trick XML parsers into accessing unauthorized files or services.*
- **Test Vectors**:

  - Data exfiltration

### **5. Broken Access Control**

#### **Authorization Bypass**

  - *Like using default passwords or leaving debug mode enabled. Security misconfiguration creates easily exploitable vulnerabilities.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - Default credentials
  - Debug mode enabled
  - Unnecessary services running
  - Insecure configurations

### **7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

#### **Stored XSS**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Poisoned Water Supply"
  - *Like contaminating a water source that everyone drinks from. Stored XSS injects malicious scripts that affect all users who view the infected content.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
  - `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
  - `<svg onload=alert('XSS')>`

#### **Reflected XSS**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Mirror That Reflects Poison"
  - *Like a mirror that reflects back whatever you show it, including dangerous images. Reflected XSS bounces malicious input back to the user who submitted it.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - URL parameter injection
  - Form input reflection
  - Search result reflection

#### **DOM-based XSS**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Tampered Instruction Manual"
  - *Like modifying instructions in a manual that others follow. DOM-based XSS manipulates client-side code to execute malicious scripts.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - Document.write() injection
  - innerHTML manipulation
  - URL fragment injection

### **8. Insecure Deserialization**

#### **Object Injection**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Fake Package Contents"
  - *Like receiving a package that looks legitimate but contains dangerous contents. Insecure deserialization allows malicious objects to be executed.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - Malicious object creation
  - Code execution via deserialization
  - Data tampering attacks

### **9. Known Vulnerabilities**

#### **Component Scanning**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Outdated Security Systems"
  - *Like using old locks that criminals know how to pick. Known vulnerabilities in components can be easily exploited by attackers.*
- **Test Vectors**:
  - Outdated libraries
  - Unpatched dependencies
  - Known CVE exploits

### **10. Insufficient Logging**

#### **Monitoring Gaps**
- **Real-World Analogy**: "Security Cameras That Don't Record"
