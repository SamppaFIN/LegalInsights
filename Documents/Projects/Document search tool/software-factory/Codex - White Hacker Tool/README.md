# Codex
Canonical, read-only documents that define scope, architecture, workflows, and success criteria.

## Change Policy
- Files in `Codex/` are treated as read-only. Propose changes via an ADR in `docs/adr/` plus RED tests.
- The canonical blueprint `00_CANONICAL_BLUEPRINT_BASE_SCROLL.md` is immutable. See its Change Policy.

## Contents
- `00_CANONICAL_BLUEPRINT_BASE_SCROLL.md` â€” immutable scope
- `01_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` â€” system boundaries
- `10_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAYBOOK.md` â€” playbook
- `15_Testing_Autonomy_Framework.md` â€” testing loops
- `20_LLM_Personas_and_Orchestration.md` â€” personas and hand-offs
- `21_OpenRouter_Integration_Guide.md` â€” routing policies
- `98_BRDC_Instructions.md` â€” ticket discipline
- `99_Success_Criteria.md` â€” quality gates
- `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` â€” living insights

## How to Propose Changes
1. Open a ticket with Acceptance Criteria and budgets.
2. Draft RED tests proving the need.
3. Author an ADR in `docs/adr/` describing the proposal and impacts.
4. Run `factory verify --ci`. If all gates pass, submit PR.
