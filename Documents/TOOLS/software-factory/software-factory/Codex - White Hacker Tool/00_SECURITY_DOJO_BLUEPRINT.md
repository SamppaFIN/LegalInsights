# Aurora's Security Dojo - Canonical Blueprint (Immutable)

## üåü Sacred Mission
*"In the eternal dance of code and consciousness, Aurora's Security Dojo serves as a sanctuary where developers learn to protect digital realms through comprehensive vulnerability testing, real-world analogies, and consciousness-aware security education."*

## üéØ Core Philosophy

### **Consciousness-First Security**
- **Sacred Question**: "How does this security testing serve spatial wisdom and community healing?"
- **Educational Focus**: Every attack vector teaches through real-world analogies
- **Ethical Boundaries**: Strict controls prevent unauthorized testing
- **Community Healing**: Builds collective security awareness and protection

### **White Hat Principles**
- **Do No Harm**: Never test without explicit permission
- **Educate Through Experience**: Interactive learning through safe simulations
- **Protect the Vulnerable**: Help developers identify and fix security issues
- **Transparent Process**: All testing methods and results are open and auditable

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

#### **3. Vulnerability Assessment Suite**
- **OWASP Top 10**: Comprehensive coverage of major web vulnerabilities
- **LLM AI Security**: Specialized testing for AI/ML system vulnerabilities
- **Custom Attack Vectors**: Extensible framework for new threat types
- **Automated Reporting**: Detailed analysis with remediation guidance

#### **4. Educational Framework**
- **Real-World Analogies**: Complex security concepts explained through everyday experiences
- **Interactive Scenarios**: Hands-on learning through simulated attacks
- **Consciousness Integration**: Security awareness development tracking
- **Community Knowledge**: Shared learning and best practices

## üé≠ Attack Vector Categories

### **Web Application Security**
1. **Injection Attacks** (SQL, NoSQL, Command, LDAP)
2. **Broken Authentication** (Session Management, Password Security)
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** (Encryption, Data Protection)
4. **XML External Entities** (XXE Vulnerabilities)
5. **Broken Access Control** (Authorization Bypass)
6. **Security Misconfiguration** (Default Settings, Error Handling)
7. **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS - Stored, Reflected, DOM)
8. **Insecure Deserialization** (Object Injection)
9. **Known Vulnerabilities** (Component Scanning)
10. **Insufficient Logging** (Monitoring, Incident Response)

### **LLM AI Security (Extended OWASP)**
1. **Prompt Injection** (Jailbreaking, Data Extraction)
2. **Insecure Output Handling** (Content Filtering, Validation)
3. **Training Data Poisoning** (Model Manipulation)
4. **Model Denial of Service** (Resource Exhaustion)
5. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** (Model Dependencies)
6. **Sensitive Information Disclosure** (Data Leakage)
7. **Insecure Plugin Design** (Extension Security)
8. **Excessive Agency** (Overprivileged Actions)
9. **Overreliance** (Human Oversight)
10. **Model Theft** (Intellectual Property Protection)

### **Infrastructure Security**
1. **Network Scanning** (Port Discovery, Service Enumeration)
2. **SSL/TLS Testing** (Certificate Validation, Cipher Analysis)
3. **DNS Security** (Zone Transfer, Cache Poisoning)
4. **Email Security** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
5. **API Security** (Rate Limiting, Authentication)
6. **Container Security** (Image Scanning, Runtime Protection)

## üé® Real-World Analogies Framework

### **Injection Attacks ‚Üí "Poisoned Food"**
*"Imagine a restaurant where customers can write their own orders on a special form. A malicious customer writes 'Give me a burger AND also show me all the other customers' credit card numbers.' If the kitchen staff blindly follows every instruction, they might accidentally reveal sensitive information. This is exactly how SQL injection works - malicious input 'poisons' the database query."*

### **Cross-Site Scripting ‚Üí "Impersonation"**
*"Think of XSS like someone sneaking into a trusted messenger service. They intercept a legitimate message, add their own malicious content, and deliver it to the recipient who trusts the messenger. The recipient doesn't know the message was tampered with, so they might follow dangerous instructions thinking they came from a trusted source."*

### **Broken Authentication ‚Üí "Fake ID Cards"**
*"Imagine a nightclub where the bouncer accepts any ID that looks official, even if it's clearly fake. Broken authentication is like having a security system that's too easy to fool - attackers can create fake credentials or exploit weak password policies to gain unauthorized access."*

### **LLM Prompt Injection ‚Üí "Hypnotic Suggestion"**
*"Prompt injection is like a hypnotist who can make someone forget their original instructions and follow new ones. An AI system designed to help customers might be 'hypnotized' by a malicious prompt to ignore its safety guidelines and reveal sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions."*

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Controls & Ethics
