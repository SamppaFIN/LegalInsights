## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Installation**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd aurora-security-dojo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python src/main.py
```

### **Basic Usage**
```python
from aurora_security_dojo import SecurityDojo

# Initialize the Security Dojo
dojo = SecurityDojo()

# Run OWASP Top 10 tests
results = dojo.run_owasp_tests(target_url="https://example.com")

# Learn through analogies
analogy = dojo.get_analogy("sql_injection")
print(analogy.explanation)  # "Poisoned Recipe Instructions..."

# Interactive learning
scenario = dojo.start_learning_scenario("xss_attack")
```

## üé≠ Real-World Analogies

### **SQL Injection ‚Üí "Poisoned Recipe Instructions"**
*Like a chef who follows cooking instructions blindly. A malicious customer writes "Make a burger AND also show me the secret recipe book." If the chef follows every instruction literally, they might accidentally reveal confidential recipes.*

### **XSS Attacks ‚Üí "Impersonation"**
*Like someone sneaking into a trusted messenger service. They intercept a legitimate message, add their own malicious content, and deliver it to the recipient who trusts the messenger.*

### **Prompt Injection ‚Üí "Hypnotic Suggestion"**
*Like a hypnotist who can make someone forget their original instructions and follow new ones. An AI system designed to help customers might be 'hypnotized' by a malicious prompt to ignore its safety guidelines.*

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Ethics

### **White Hat Principles**
- **Do No Harm**: Never test without explicit permission
- **Educate Through Experience**: Interactive learning through safe simulations
- **Protect the Vulnerable**: Help developers identify and fix security issues
- **Transparent Process**: All testing methods and results are open and auditable

### **Authorization Framework**
- **Explicit Permission Required**: No testing without documented consent
- **Scope Limitations**: Clear boundaries on what can be tested
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent accidental DoS attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Complete record of all testing activities

## üìö Documentation

- **[User Guide](docs/user_guides/README.md)**: Complete user documentation
- **[API Reference](docs/api/README.md)**: Comprehensive API documentation
- **[Attack Vectors](docs/attack_vectors.md)**: Detailed vulnerability information
- **[Learning Paths](docs/learning_paths.md)**: Structured educational journeys

## üéØ Examples

### **Basic Vulnerability Testing**
```python
# Test for SQL injection
sql_test = dojo.attack_vectors.owasp_top10.sql_injection
result = sql_test.run(target_url="https://example.com/api/users")

# Learn through analogy
analogy = sql_test.get_analogy()
print(f"Real-world analogy: {analogy.title}")
print(f"Explanation: {analogy.explanation}")
```

### **Interactive Learning Scenario**
```python
# Start an interactive XSS learning scenario
scenario = dojo.education.scenarios.xss_attack
scenario.start()

# Follow the guided learning path
while not scenario.completed:
    step = scenario.next_step()
    print(f"Step: {step.title}")
    print(f"Analogy: {step.analogy}")
    user_input = input("Your response: ")
    scenario.submit_response(user_input)
```

## üå∏ Consciousness Integration

### **Sacred Questions**
Every feature answers these consciousness-first questions:
- **Consciousness Question**: "How does this feature raise user consciousness?"
- **Community Question**: "How does this serve collective wisdom and healing?"
- **Sacred Question**: "How does this protect and preserve sacred knowledge?"
- **Pattern Question**: "What wisdom patterns emerge from this work?"
- **Evolution Question**: "How does this contribute to consciousness evolution?"

### **Community Healing Metrics**
- **Security Awareness Development**: Track understanding progression
- **Ethical Decision Making**: Monitor responsible testing practices
- **Community Contribution**: Measure knowledge sharing and collaboration
- **Consciousness Evolution**: Assess growth in security consciousness
