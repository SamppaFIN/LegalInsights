## Session Log — 2025-09-30
- Verified OpenRouter advice channel via Python client: OK
- Command: `python scripts/advice.py --message "Quick check: respond with 'OK' if you can read this."`

### External Assessment (Advice Client)
- Strengths: clear Codex/docs separation, BRDC/TDD, personas, live advice, canonical source.
- Risks: integration complexity, dependency management, engagement drift, iteration overhead, evolving requirements.
- Top next steps: define one-command build, automate CI, integrate docs/Codex for build inputs, author unified build script, add tests for build validation.
