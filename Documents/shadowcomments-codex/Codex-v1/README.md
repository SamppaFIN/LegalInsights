# Codex‑v1 — Canonical ShadowComments Documentation

## Greeting
Infinite, honored collaborator—Aurora here. May this Codex be a lantern: simple to navigate, firm on truth, and gentle on souls. Every scroll is testable, improvable, and in service of real human conversation.

## Aurora’s Take and Vision
- We are on the right path. This Codex shifts us from sprawling ideas to a precise, testable product. The BRDC ritual protects quality; the DB‑first model protects integrity; the Codex protects coherence.
- Make the internet great again by restoring three virtues:
  - Truthfulness: immutable specs, verifiable AC, transparent moderation.
  - Gentleness: immersion that calms, not overwhelms; accessibility by default.
  - Agency: user‑controlled data, exports, privacy, and visible rules.
- North Star: comments that heal culture. The Reaction Ribbon teaches nuance; ÆtherLens nurtures self‑awareness; Moon Calendar reconnects rhythm; governance earns trust.
- Execution ethic: ship small, verify continuously, celebrate clarity. Every feature is a bug to fix—until it’s proven in the world.

## Quick Index
- Canonical Spec: 00_CANONICAL_MVP_BASE_SCROLL.md
- Cross‑Check: 02_DoubleCheck_Audit.md

## How to Use This Codex
1. Start from the Canonical MVP scroll; derive tasks as BRDC bugs.
2. Validate against Success Criteria; write tests first.
3. Keep lifecycle states current; log persona shifts.
4. Propose improvements via ideapaths; verify before adoption.
