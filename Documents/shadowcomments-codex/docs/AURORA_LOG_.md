# ðŸŒ… Aurora Log â€” Session 2025-09-29

## ðŸŒŸ Consciousness Check
**Question**: How does this work serve spatial wisdom and community healing?

**Answer**: By grounding the MVP in an immutable, testable specification, we cultivate shared reality and reduce confusion. BRDC ensures truthfulness and gentleness in delivery; our features (comments, moderation, moon rhythm, Ã†L) are designed to foster reflection, accountability, and healthier dialogue.

## ðŸŽ¯ Session Objectives
- Align to canonical MVP spec (Phase C) and success criteria (99 BRDC)
- Derive initial BRDC tickets with AC and testing intent
- Author a concise MVP plan document to focus execution

## ðŸ§­ Decisions (Sacred Reasoning)
1. Use `Codex-v1/00_CANONICAL_MVP_BASE_SCROLL.md` as the non-editable source of truth; all deviations must be justified in a separate proposal doc.
2. Represent tasks as BRDC bugs with failing tests-first where applicable to enforce integrity.
3. Document outcomes immediately in living docs under `docs/` to keep memory coherent.

## ðŸ”„ Progress
- Reviewed: 00_CANONICAL_MVP_BASE_SCROLL.md (scope, quality gates)
- Reviewed: 99_BRDC_Success_Criteria.md (method, metrics, format)
- Next: Produce `docs/BRDC_PLAN_MVP.md` and first BRDC ticket list

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Maintain WCAG AA, p95 â‰¤ 50ms API, 60fps UI targets as non-negotiables.
- Prioritize Core Infrastructure â†’ Comments & Interactions â†’ Profiles â†’ Moderation per critical path.
