# Canonical Blueprint Scope (Immutable)

Mission: Build a self-sustaining factory where agents and humans co-create through five autonomous loops: Sacred Code Protection, Living Documentation, Quality Assurance, Community Feedback, Consciousness Evolution.

Non-Negotiables
- Consciousness-first: Each change must answer the sacred question.
- BRDC: Treat every ticket as a bug; tests precede code.
- Open Audits: Architecture, decisions, and logs are transparent.
- RLS/Security by default: Principle of least privilege.
- Performance Budgets: p95 API < 50ms; UI 60fps.

Factory Outcomes
- Autogen Tickets → RED tests → Code → GREEN → Docs → Release.
- AURORA_LOG captures personas, decisions, and metrics every cycle.
- Multi-model routing via OpenRouter with cost/perf governance.

Deliverables (Phase 1)
- Agent Orchestrator with persona hand-off.
- Test Authoring Agent (RED-first) and Fix Agent (GREEN).
- Documentation Agent syncing AURORA_LOG and codex docs.
- CI pipeline enforcing 99_Success_Criteria gates.

Change Policy
- This scroll is immutable. Proposals require a separate ADR with tests.
