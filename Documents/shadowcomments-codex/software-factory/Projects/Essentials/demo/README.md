## 🚦 BRDC Practice
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR enforced in CI; minimal reversible edits; all changes update AURORA_LOG and codex parity.

## 🔌 OpenRouter Integration (Free-First)
Route simple tasks to free/low-cost models; escalate by risk; cross-verify; persist cost/trace.

### Usage Quickstart
- Build: `./build.sh` or `./build.ps1`
- NPM: `npm run factory:build` (also: plan, red, green, verify, docs)
- Advice flags: set `ADVICE_ON_PLAN=1` or `ADVICE_ON_DOCS=1`
